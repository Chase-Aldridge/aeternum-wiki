## Philosophy

The Trinitum seeks:
- **Power in the shadows** - Influence rather than direct control
- **Religious devotion** - Servants of Tiamat and Draconiss
- **Spreading influence abroad** - Under Zaz's leadership
- **Ancient traditions** - Ruled by red nobility for generations

## Rivalry with The Black Order

A cold war exists between:
- **The Trinitum** - Old nobility, religious, subtle
- **The Black Order** - Military, cruel, direct
- Sasaren's rise threatens Trinitum's traditional power
