## The Magisterium

The most secretive faction in Gul'Rath:

- **Masters of magic colleges** based on bloodlines
- **Absolute secrecy** and compartmentalization
- **Psionic research** - Recently discovered potential
- **Connections to the Nine Hells** and Outer Realms

## Independence

CORMANDIR remains free because:
- The Magisterium's power deters aggression
- No kingdom wants to make an enemy of them
- Their knowledge and services are too valuable
- The cost of conquest would be catastrophic

## Dark Research

Rumors speak of:
- Psionic experiments on unwilling subjects
- Deals with devils and demons
- Ancient knowledge best left forgotten
- Plans that span centuries
