## Background

Commander Striker Horun is known throughout Gul'Rath as **"elvenkind's strongest soldier"** - a title earned through decades of martial excellence and his decisive victory in THE RED CRUSADE.

As general of the Golden Legions, he commands 44,000 highly trained elven warriors, the greatest military force among the high elves.

## The Red Crusade

The defining moment of Horun's legend came during THE RED CRUSADE, a decade-long war that threatened to tear the continent apart:

### The Betrayal
When Archknight Maldrake and his wild elf bloodletters launched their campaign of total war against the combined alliance, it fell to Horun to lead the counter-offensive.

### The Victory
Striker Horun personally defeated the betrayer Archknight Maldrake in combat, ending THE RED CRUSADE with a pyrrhic but decisive victory. The wild elves were banished to THE BLOOD LANDS.

## House Horun

Striker Horun leads the lesser noble HOUSE HORUN, which despite its "lesser" status controls the most powerful military force in VOL'ANLEK:

- **Population:** 44,000+ sworn soldiers
- **Composition:** Fighters, Paladins, Clerics, Rangers, Monks
- **Specialty:** Regimented war stratagems
- **Rivalry:** Political tension with HOUSE ALEPHOR

## Military Philosophy

The Golden Legion under Horun's command is renowned for:

- **Discipline:** Strict military hierarchy and training
- **Tactics:** Coordinated battlefield maneuvers
- **Honor:** A code that distinguishes them from other factions
- **Elite Forces:** The highest quality elven warriors

## Relationships

### With Grand Hierophant Ludus Alephor
The two most powerful elves in VOL'ANLEK maintain an uneasy partnership:
- Alephor controls religious and political power
- Horun controls military might
- Both noble houses share power, but tensions simmer beneath the surface

### With Other Kingdoms
As the hero who ended THE RED CRUSADE, Horun is:
- Respected by the IRONHELM dwarves as a worthy ally
- Feared by the yuan-ti of TAMARYEN
- Watched carefully by the MAGISTERIUM

## Equipment

- **Blade of Helion** - Legendary elven longsword
- **The Golden Citadel** - His fortress headquarters
- **Golden Legion Standard** - Inspires troops in battle

## Legacy

Striker Horun represents the martial ideal of the high elves - disciplined, honorable, and devastatingly effective in war. His victory in THE RED CRUSADE cemented his legend, but the peace he won remains fragile.

Some whisper that another war is coming, and when it does, all eyes will turn to elvenkind's strongest soldier once more.
