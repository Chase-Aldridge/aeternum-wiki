# Gul'Rath

**The Northern Continent**

Gul'Rath is the far northern continent of LOR where the original campaign began. Recorded history here begins over 10,000 years ago as detailed by the findings hidden in the ancient ruins dotting the land. Whatever civilization first emerged here is unclear, but evidence suggests they were some type of exiled kingdom from beyond the Material Plane.

## Geography

The diverse continent is characterized by:
- Massive fields of highgrass
- Humid jungles
- Desolate volcanic mountains
- Crystalline deserts
- Vast stretches of island archipelagos

Gul'Rath is somewhat isolated due to the vast oceanic distances required to travel south by sea, and the massive tracks of the unexplored **Aer Desert** covering the bottom of the continent.

## The Red Crusade

The varied kingdoms of Gul'Rath share a hard-won peace after a decade-long war known as **The Red Crusade**, where a splinter faction of the high elven kingdom of Vol'Anlek waged total war against the combined alliance of:
- The **Tamaryen** yuan-ti
- The **Ironhelm** dwarves
- The **Dragmar Aer** aarakocra

The devastating conflict ended with a pyrrhic victory where the wild elves were banished to **The Blood Lands** and the major kingdoms vassalized most of the lesser factions in the peace accords.

## Current Era

A new era of peace and political intrigue has begun with each nation seeking to consolidate their power base through:
- Trade
- Ritual
- Exploration
- Plots
