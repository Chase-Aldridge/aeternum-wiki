## The Only Independent Power

THE MAGISTERIUM is the only non-vassalized power remaining after THE RED CRUSADE. While other lesser kingdoms bent the knee, CORMANDIR's mages retained their independence through:

- Magical might too dangerous to challenge
- Secrets too valuable to lose
- Connections too dark to risk exposing

## Structure

The Magisterium operates through:

### Colleges of Magic
- Each college based on hereditary bloodlines
- Absolute secrecy between colleges
- Compartmentalized knowledge and assets

### Research
- Recently discovered **psionic potential**
- Known connections to **the Nine Hells**
- Dealings with the **Outer Realms**

## Agents

The Magisterium deploys:
- Spies in every major kingdom
- Agents pursuing arcane artifacts
- Assassins when required
- Diplomats when useful

## Dark Reputation

Rumors about the Magisterium include:
- Experiments on living subjects
- Deals with devils and demons
- Knowledge that drove mages mad
- Plans spanning centuries

## Why They Remain Free

No kingdom attacks CORMANDIR because:
- The Magisterium's retaliation would be devastating
- Their knowledge is too valuable
- Their secrets could destroy anyone
- The cost far outweighs any gain
