# Indigenous Peoples of Plagas

The native inhabitants of the wild continent.

## The Leonin Tribes

The leonin are the dominant indigenous species of PLAGAS, organized into fierce tribal structures.

### The Red Mane Tribe
The Red Mane tribe is known to be savage and ruthless in war. Their raiding parties still make it to the coastal colonies every few years. Their territories and hunting grounds are believed to run through the entire northern reaches of rainforest.

**Raankor Boneshatter**, War Leader of the Red Mane tribe, leads warbands in the north ambushing and scalping any Fort Runestone forces on sight.

### The White Fang Tribe
The White Fang tribe is said to rule over the southern jungles and apparently are peerless monster hunters and trappers. They seem to be even more elusive than their counterparts, and no jungle explorer or seafaring trader seems to ever return to tell their tale.

**Anar Oathbane**, famed hunter of the White Fang tribe, has been spotted moving towards the coast with multiple hunting parties to contest the interlopers.

## The Loxodon Shamans

A third and more mysterious nameless faction is said to exist somewhere in the central jungle hills - the sacred class of Loxodon shamans and medicine men who mediate between the major warring leonin tribes.

**The Oakspeaker** is an elusive loxodon shaman. Legends tell of the shamanic high priests who preside over the Leonin tribes, never seen outside the jungle. Any expeditions who have encountered them report memory loss.

**Prophlos** is an ancient loxodon shaman encountered in Pol Tarei.

## Grey Skar

**Grey Skar** is the oldest Leonin freed slave in Pol Tarei. He was formerly White Fang, on the council, but had a failed hunt and was ousted. He has shared that when he "saw the omen" it was called "Ihn Rahkesh".
