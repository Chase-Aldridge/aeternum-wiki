## Relations with Colonizers

The indigenous peoples of PLAGAS have suffered greatly from colonization:
- **Fort Runestone** actively enslaves Leonin and Loxodon
- **Other colonies** encroach on hunting grounds
- **Monster hunting** disrupts sacred traditions
- **Resource extraction** destroys jungle habitats

This has created deep hostility toward all outsiders, though some freed slaves have begun integrating in places like Pol Tarei.
