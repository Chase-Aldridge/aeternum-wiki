## Description

A research and magical colony run by the MAGISTERIUM of GUL'RATH. Little is known about the tower other than their steady streams of supply ships and expeditions into the jungle.

Highly secretive and reclusive mages, warlocks, wizards, and sorcerers are assumed to be conducting experimental spellcraft within.

**High Magister Telerian** is rumored to be supporting Fort Runestone armies on behalf of The Magisterium with clandestine scrying, secret teleportation circles, mercenary battlemages, and potent artifacts.
