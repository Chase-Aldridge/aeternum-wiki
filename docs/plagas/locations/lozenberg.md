## Description

A small free city colony originally founded by outlaws, traders, sailors, and hunters migrating across the seas from GUL'RATH.

This settlement is home to a myriad of races, religions, and classes from across LOR, seeking fortune or exile on the wilderness frontier. The city is perhaps the most welcoming to travelers, though your coin purse is as likely to be cut as your throat should trouble arise.

**The Sand Sparrow** leads the merchant-bandits and pirate princes, mobilizing in the titan hunt at the behest of Gul'Rath nobles.
