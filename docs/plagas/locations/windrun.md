## Description

An Imperial colony run by the warforged hosts of FORTEA seeking to expand their diplomatic and military power.

Outsiders must adhere to a strict code of conduct and economic sanctions when visiting or doing trade here. The shrewd commanders have been known to launch military expeditions over land and sea deep into wild PLAGAS territories with goals unknown.

**Lord Myrros, Supreme Centurion** personally leads the Fortean Imperium forces overland through the middle of the archipelago on the Titan hunt. Though slow moving, the legions of warforged march day and night.
