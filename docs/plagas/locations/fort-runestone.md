## Description

A well established Duergar mining and slaving colony from CTHON. The dark dwarves have come to PLAGAS to pillage the rich natural ore veins, capture valuable Leonin and Loxodon slaves, and gather the various rare plant and monster raw materials of the jungle continent.

The oldest colony known on this wild land, they are hesitant to welcome outsiders though they do employ ample bounty hunters, monster trappers, and mercenary forces internationally.

**General Korax** leads the duergar and drow mercenary forces in the north camp to look for the titanic beasts.
