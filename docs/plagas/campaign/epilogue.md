# Epilogue: After the Aeternum Crisis

*It has been 4 years since the events of the "AETERNUM CRISIS" and the fall of the magical mist surrounding humanity's continent AETERNUM on LOR. The year is 1116AE according to their calendar...*

## Changes in Aeternum

### The Fall of Nejune
After NEJUNE's total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant", an ancient evil seemed to seep into the ruins and surrounding lands in the form of a violet miasma, cursing the crops and peoples with eldritch magic. Many whisper this is due to the 7 seals being finally broken since the dawn era 1000 years ago.

The surviving smaller city states south of NEJUNE barely eke out a living being ruled by militias of surviving mages, constantly set upon by undead and hordes of raiders.

### The Battle at Magus Rise
BLACK FANG "The Void Walker", NERO VALUS "The Immortal", and the Illithid Lord known as THE PANTOKRATOR allegedly engaged in a titanic magical & psionic duel over the ruins of MAGUS RISE at the end of 1111AE. The results of the battle and the combatants' survival are unknown; the ruins are declared off-limits officially by the major kingdoms.

### The Silent Gods
The original pantheon of demigods born from mortals during the dawn era on AETERNUM: **Lokhir, Alaya, Heronimus, Bel'Mog, Oberon & Leira** have all but lost their power and influence, mysteriously going silent in 1112AE to their followers and cultists.

Many scholars theorize this was the ultimate effect of the winds of magic being sealed and then released again during the "end times" events when Kronus was banished from the Material Plane.

### The Metallic Dragons
It is dreamt by many prophets and seers that worship BAHAMUT, DRACONISS, & LEVIATHAN that the goodly metallic dragon gods have chosen not to show themselves yet to the peoples of AETERNUM as they did in the dawn era. Many aspirants made for THE ISLE OF THE DRAGON and sought refuge within the guarded TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT to await this future day.

### The Missing Avatar
AENARION THE HAWK (the only surviving avatar of SILVANUS) remains missing in action. Many believe he is either the new FELLWOOD elven warlord "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" or is backing/training him.

### The Qunari Prophecy
THE QUNARI sent word to the major kingdoms through their aasimar chaplains in 1112AE that "Qunari Rule" shall return in 10 years and a day since the start of the "end times prophecy" triggered in 1111AE.

**Meaning in 1121AE** the major houses of AETERNUM will have to meet in ritual atop the holy mountain LOKHIR'S SUMMIT to decide the continent's future fate. There is much contention around this still politically with the newfound peace and shaky stability.

### Other Changes
- **The Fellwood**: GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT, and many furry forest friends slowly return to a cleansed FELLWOOD full of bountiful nut, fruit, and berry
- **Cult of Pelor**: The neutral good god of the sun and agriculture has gained a large cult following among commoners, due to the influx of traders from GUL'RATH
- **Tomb Honey Trade**: The sale and illicit trade has grown swiftly in MERIA and entered black markets in DARGO and THE FELLWOOD
- **Aetherius**: Now a demilitarized city zone of trade ruled by a joint council from MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD
- **The Arken Company**: Officially disbanded, assassin forces absorbed into THE GUILD. FORT BANE converted into a trade port
- **The Emerald Isles**: Settlers continue to arrive from and depart to via DARGO
- **Waja-San**: The DRACONISS dragonborn founded their own island village to honor their sensei
- **Meria**: Now the strongest kingdom, led by LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR & LADY NYNORA
- **Thanes Hold**: Retaken by CLAN THORGREM under HIGH KING THANOR
- **Dargo**: Underwent political chaos, now ruled by steward RYLAND THE PIOUS
- **The Forsaken**: Either genocided or exiled after the DARGO dealings with illithids were revealed

## Contact with Other Continents
- Delegations from **CTHON** and **FORTEA** arrived in 1114AE (results unknown)
- No official contact with **REGELUM** has been reported
- **THE EXPLORER'S ASSOCIATION** made contact with MERIA in 1112AE
