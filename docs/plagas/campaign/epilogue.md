# THE LEGEND OF THE RUSITAURI

*What became of the heroes after the Aeternum Crisis*

## After the Fall of Nejune

The fatetouched heroes regrouped after the fall of NEJUNE and assisted THE VOICE as members of THE GUILD council in brokering a new, albeit tenuous geopolitical peace on AETERNUM.

Seen as legendary protectors of the realm by many and political-extremist vigilantes by others, they helped guide the newly formed council of the continent to stabilize and rebuild the kingdoms of **MERIA**, **DARGO**, and **THANE'S HOLD** before departing on their own personal quests.

## The Heroes' Rewards

Given leave and considerable political and financial rewards from THE GUILD, the heroes established:
- Staff, followers, equipment, fleet, and armory within the GUILD tower inside MERIA
- Access to **THE SHADOW CITADEL** in LIMBO (formerly KET's headquarters, now THE VOICE's throne)

## Final Quests

### The Mouth of Woe

The heroes journeyed to THE MOUTH OF WOE at the end of 1111AE to aid EGGBERT in finding the sealed resting place of his wife and finally letting her go - releasing her body from suspended magical animation and letting death "officially" take her.

**METAGAMUS** appeared to EGGBERT in a dream and revealed the radically different life paths that now lay before him.

### ULRICK's Fate

Due to the breaking of OBERON's power as a god in the Fey Court, the demigod started to fade from the plane and his hold on the FEYWILD was no more. Other Fey Nobles fought for power of the throne.

In the chaos, the disembodied soul of **ULRICK** escaped and was accidentally planeshifted into the twin heaven plane of **BYTOPIA**. There a benevolent wind djinn discovered him and sealed him in a pure adamantine jar, later befriending and bargaining with the hero... towards fates unknown.

### ZADSHEN's Rescue

In early 1112AE, with the aid of a broken **AMAUD STURNSTAR** and a returned half-demon **ELENA DRAGONSONG**, the heroes re-entered the hell plane of **PANDEMONIUM** and confronted its lord **GARAGOS** to battle for the return of ZADSHEN's soul.

In a twist of fate, **EGGBERT** offered his soul heroically in exchange - now tortured and bound for eternity there instead, giving the gnome some ironic respite from the chaos of meaninglessness without his wife.

**ZADSHEN** was reborn into a new human body, but psychologically worn down from (his planar perspective) 17 years of torture at the hands of GARAGOS. He chose not to return to AETERNUM and instead to retire and serve as an acolyte to THE QUNARI atop **MOUNT CELESTIA** to fulfill his oath, seek redemption, and live out his remaining years as a mortal aasimar.

## The Journey to Regelum

Seeing EGGBERT sacrifice himself, as well as the broken ZAD, changed SHO and ODA. SHO especially started to really go within himself and question everything. ODA suspected a remnant mark from the DEMON OF RAGE had colored SHO permanently as he became more aggressive.

### The Assault

Upon landing in REGELUM, they were assaulted by an army of **THE RED SHOGUN, JIREN SAI**. They killed around **1,000** kobold and lizardfolk ashigaru plus dragonborn samurai before being captured.

### The Prophecy Fulfilled

The prophecy from SHO's encounter with THE PROPHET OF BAHAMUT came to be as JIREN ordered SHO to commit seppuku. However, ODA used his domain at the last second to conceal them and they were able to planeshift out of the RED SHOGUN's castle.

The two got separated from there and this is where their lore becomes rumor...

## Legacy

### The Voice and Cicero

**CICERO WINDBLADE** remains the right hand of THE VOICE. The two now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both **bankai** and **domain expansion** at a level beyond their physical limits.

**BOREAS THE OX** and his entire elite hit squad were slain while hunting the trail of BLACK FANG as THE GUILD sought to tie up loose ends in 1111AE.

They now set their sights on expanding their power to other continents through strong trade alliances, beginning with GUL'RATH as THE EXPLORER'S ASSOCIATION made contact with MERIA in 1112AE.

### International Contact

- Delegations from **CTHON** and **FORTEA** arrived in 1114AE (results unknown)
- No official contact with **REGELUM** has been reported
- **THE RED HORDE** remnants moved underground into the Underdark near THE MOUTH OF WOE
- Bounty hunters and pirates from **ZONOS** continue to sneak into THE GRAY WASTES
