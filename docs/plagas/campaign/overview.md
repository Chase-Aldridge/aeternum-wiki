# THE PLAGAS PROPHECY

*"The Sequel to the Aeternum Crisis"*

## Setting

**Year:** 1116 AE - Four years after the Aeternum Crisis

**Location:** The continent of PLAGAS, a massive rainforest and desertified archipelago to the far west of Aeternum.

## The World After the Crisis

It has been 4 years since the events of the "AETERNUM CRISIS" and the fall of the magical mist surrounding humanity's continent AETERNUM on LOR. The world has changed dramatically since the winds of magic shifted and geopolitics opened up.

### What is Plagas?

PLAGAS is a land of:
- **Wild Mystery** - Unexplored jungles hiding ancient secrets
- **Lawlessness** - No central authority, might makes right
- **Titanic Monster Hunts** - Colossal beasts roam the wilderness
- **Colonization** - Foreign powers establishing footholds
- **Loxodon Plant Shamanism** - Elephant-folk wielding nature magic
- **Ruthless Leonin Tribal Politics** - Lion-folk clans warring for dominance

Very few civilizations have managed to gain a foothold other than colonies due to:
- Extreme danger of the thick jungles
- Unforgiving beasts roaming the lands
- Secretive indigenous leonin tribes that hunt there

## Changes in Aeternum (1111-1116 AE)

### The Destruction of Nejune
After NEJUNE's total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant", an ancient evil seeped into the ruins in the form of a violet miasma, cursing the crops and peoples with eldritch magic. Many whisper this is due to the 7 seals being finally broken since the dawn era 1000 years ago.

### The Battle at Magus Rise
BLACK FANG "The Void Walker", NERO VALUS "The Immortal", and the Illithid Lord known as THE PANTOKRATOR allegedly engaged in a titanic magical & psionic duel over the ruins of MAGUS RISE at the end of 1111AE. The results and the combatants' survival are unknown; the ruins are declared off-limits.

### The Silence of the Demigods
The original pantheon of demigods born from mortals during the dawn era (Lokhir, Alaya, Heronmius, Bel'Mog, Oberon & Leira) have all but lost their power and influence, mysteriously going silent in 1112AE. Scholars theorize this was the ultimate effect of the winds of magic being sealed and then released again when Kronus was banished.

### The Metallic Dragon Mystery
It is dreamt by prophets and seers that worship BAHAMUT, DRACONISS, & LEVIATHAN that the goodly metallic dragon gods have chosen not to show themselves yet as they did in the dawn era. Many aspirants made for THE ISLE OF THE DRAGON and sought refuge within the guarded TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT.

### The Qunari Prophecy
THE QUNARI sent word to the major kingdoms through their aasimar chaplains in 1112AE that "Qunari Rule" shall return in 10 years and a day since the start of the "end times prophecy" triggered in 1111AE. Meaning in **1121AE** the major houses of AETERNUM will have to meet in ritual atop LOKHIR'S SUMMIT to decide the continent's future fate.

## The New Political Order

### MERIA
The human and dwarven council has voted in a matriarchal duo of powerful female leaders: **LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR** & **LADY NYNORA**. Their cunning political maneuvering surrounding trade has made their kingdom the strongest on AETERNUM (under the watchful thumb of The Voice and his Guild council).

### DARGO
Underwent political chaos as the steward COUNT QUERLOS went missing and the rising CULT OF DRAGONSPEAR seized power (with shadowy GUILD assistance). Forsaken were purged, the nobility overthrown. The new steward is **"RYLAND THE PIOUS"**. King BEREN, GEREN THE WARHAMMER, and KING ZADSHEN are revered as saints.

### THANE'S HOLD
Slowly retaken by the dwarves of CLAN THORGREM in a brutal war with the remnants of the greenskin RED HORDE. The plutocracy of dwarven merchant guilds under **HIGH KING THANOR** is in ascendancy once more.

### THE GUILD
Has slowly, unbeknownst to much of the populace, instilled a new secular, meritocratic philosophy known as **"The Oath"** which promotes:
- Formation of artisan guilds
- Banishing of noble houses
- Rise of the common man through labor and genius

### THE TWILIGHT REAVERS
**GUILDMASTER OREON**, **LU ZHONG THE TIGER**, **GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS**, and **RYUZEN THE DRUNKEN PHOENIX** became the new warlords heading MERIA's elite mercenary force. They amassed a large military and trade fleet and set sail north in 1114AE into the uncharted seas with the blessing of THE VOICE.

## The Fates of the Rusitauri

### ODA
Returned to DARGO and the temple of THE CONIN with LUAN BO to train a new generation and craft his own personal martial art.

### ZADSHEN
Reborn into a new human body after 17 years of planar torture (from his perspective). Psychologically worn down, he chose not to return to AETERNUM and instead to retire and serve as an acolyte to THE QUNARI atop MOUNT CELESTIA.

### SHO
Returned to REGELUM as an avenger and began a rebellion against THE RED SHOGUN after being overcome with rage at the plight of the dragonborn people. He and ODA were captured after killing around 1,000 enemies, but escaped using ODA's domain.

### EGGBERT
Offered his soul heroically in exchange for ZADSHEN's freedom from PANDEMONIUM. He now lies tortured and bound for eternity there, giving the gnome some ironic respite from the chaos of meaninglessness without his wife.

### ULRICK
His disembodied soul escaped when OBERON's power broke, accidentally planeshifted into BYTOPIA. A benevolent wind djinn discovered him and sealed him in a pure adamantine jar.

### THE VOICE
Along with CICERO WINDBLADE, now largely rules AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after mastering both bankai and domain expansion beyond their physical limits. They set their sights on expanding power to other continents through trade alliances.

## The New Dragonborn

### WAJA-SAN
The DRACONISS dragonborn founded their own island village named WAJA-SAN to honor their sensei Master Waja and his peaceful death in 1112AE.

### The New Masters
- **KISHIMOTO DRACONBLADE** - New master of THE SOUL WASHERS
- **BENGROR THE MIGHTY** - Right hand sword
- **YURIO ZARASHI** - Third sword of the village

They train the next generation in the ways of Dragon Bushido.

## Other Major Developments

- **PELOR** has gained a large cult following among commoners, due to the influx of traders from GUL'RATH
- **Tomb honey** trade has grown swiftly and entered black markets everywhere
- **AETHERIUS** is now a demilitarized city zone ruled by joint council from MERIA, DARGO, and THANE'S HOLD
- **THE ARKEN COMPANY** is disbanded, forces absorbed into THE GUILD
- **GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT** and other furry forest friends slowly return to a cleansed FELLWOOD
- **MISTRAYA** finally dies of old age in 1113AE as ALAYA's power wanes
- **THE VIRIDIAN WOLF** - a peerless elven warrior (possibly AENARION) - runs the power channels of THE FELLWOOD in shadow
