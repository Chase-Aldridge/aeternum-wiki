# Plagas

**The Wild Frontier**

The campaign opens in **1116 AE** with new heroes meeting one another on this massive rainforest and desertified archipelago continent to the far west.

## Description

Plagas is a land of:
- Wild mystery and lawlessness
- Titanic monster hunts
- Colonial settlements competing for resources
- Loxodon plant shamanism
- Ruthless leonin tribal politics

Very few civilizations have managed to gain a foothold other than colonies on the coasts due to:
- Extreme danger from thick jungles
- Unforgiving beasts roaming the lands
- Secretive indigenous leonin tribes

## Climate & Geography

Since the Aeternum Crisis, LOR's poles have shifted:
- Extreme poles are now subtropical or tundra
- Ice belt is closer to the equator
- Plagas features rainforests and deserts across an archipelago
