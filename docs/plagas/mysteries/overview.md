# Mysteries of Plagas

The unexplored secrets of the wild continent.

## The Za'an Ruins
The Za'an Ruins are said to be a legendary "Forebearer" city lost to time hidden among the jungles. Treasure hunters and explorers disagree on its exact location - many have sought it, few have survived.

## The Golden City
One of the favorite myths and legends told around gambling tables by drunken sailors across LOR. A rumored citadel of vast riches watched over by the most sacred orders of Loxodon and Leonin warriors and shamans.

Many scholars dismiss its actual existence citing the "savages' inability to actually raise cities."

## Titan Beasts
PLAGAS is home to titanic monster hunts. The various colonies have launched expeditions to hunt these massive creatures for glory and profit.

### The Titan Hunt
Multiple factions are competing in the titan hunt:
- **Fort Runestone** - General Korax leads duergar and drow forces in the north
- **Windrun** - Lord Myrros leads warforged legions through the middle
- **Lozenberg** - The Sand Sparrow mobilizes merchant-bandits
- **Pol Tarei** - Markus Swiftsail's buccaneers support Lozenberg
- **Explorer's Association** - Darius Kane himself traveled to PLAGAS with elite agents

## Other Mysteries

Countless rumors and legends persist among the colonies:
- Ancient tombs
- Geomantic ley lines
