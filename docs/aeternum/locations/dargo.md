## Description

DARGO underwent political chaos as the steward COUNT QUERLOS went missing and the rising CULT OF DRAGONSPEAR seized power with shadowy GUILD assistance, installing a semi-dictatorship.

Forsaken were purged from the city and the people overthrew the nobility. The throne remains empty as PRINCE FAGREN DRAGONSPEAR and his younger sister PRINCESS HERA DRAGONSPEAR were both found dead soon after the new council of powers met at the end of 1111AE.

The new steward is a priest from the cult known as RYLAND THE PIOUS. KING BEREN, GEREN THE WARHAMMER, and KING ZADSHEN are all revered as saints because of their sacrifices.

The city is now home to a refounded dojo and temple to THE CONIN, where LUAN BO and ODA train the next generation.
