## Description

A desolate wasteland territory in AETERNUM, home to hostile greenskin tribes and dangerous monsters.

Small elite bands of bounty hunters, rogue pirates, brigands, and caravans of traders from the lawless ZONOS continue to sneak into THE GRAY WASTES from its northern shores and battle the greenskin hordes and titanic beasts there.

They have been rumored to clash with THORGREM and MERIA forces from time to time, and have been said to have retaken the ruins of THE GRAY GATE.

THE RED HORDE remnants are said to have largely moved their tribes and warbands underground into the Underdark near and around THE MOUTH OF WOE as the forces of order gained power after 1111AE.

## Key Locations

- The Gray Gate (Contested)
- The Mouth of Woe
- Underdark entrances
