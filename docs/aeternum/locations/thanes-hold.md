## Description

THANES HOLD has been slowly retaken and resettled (with help from GUILD and MERIA forces) by the dwarves of CLAN THORGREM in a brutal war of attrition with the remnants of the greenskin RED HORDE.

The plutocracy of the dwarven merchant guilds under the iron fist of HIGH KING THANOR are now in ascendancy once more as they reopen trade and return to their top economic monopolies on forged goods and ores.

The city is the ancestral home of the dwarven clans and houses some of the finest forges and smithies in all of AETERNUM.

## Key Locations

- The Great Forge
- Clan Thorgrem Hall
