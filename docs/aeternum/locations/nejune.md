## Description

NEJUNE suffered total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant" during the Aeternum Crisis.

An ancient evil seemed to seep into the ruins and surrounding lands in the form of a violet miasma, cursing the crops and peoples with eldritch magic. Many whisper this is due to the 7 seals being finally broken since the dawn era 1000 years ago.

The surviving smaller city states south of NEJUNE barely eke out a living being ruled by militias of surviving mages, constantly set upon by undead and hordes of raiders.

The ruins of MAGUS RISE nearby are declared off-limits officially by the major kingdoms after the titanic magical and psionic duel between BLACK FANG, NERO VALUS, and THE PANTOKRATOR.

## Key Locations

- Ruins of Magus Rise (Off-Limits)
- The Nejune Catacombs
- The Scarlet Drake (Destroyed)
