:::

## Description

A bleak and mysterious city of incipient shadow and violent excess. Though seemingly less advanced in construction than other major cities, Nejune was the **most magically charged settlement** in all of Aeternum.

Bordered by the eerie boughs of **The Darkwood** and the swamp-infested wastes of **The Shadowlands**.

Ruled by **necromancers**, **sorcerers**, and **seasoned wizards**, this was a perilous place for outsiders to tread without great need.

## City Structure

### The Lawless City
- No formal law enforcement
- Power enforced by magical might
- Central political spire: **Nejune Tower**

### The Catacombs
A four-tiered complex spanning beneath the city:
- **Upper levels** - Trapped sewer tunnels with secret exits to noble villas
- **Lower levels** - Caves and underground tomb strongholds
- **Lowest level** - Undercroft with **7 magically sealed gates** from ancient times

The first two seals were broken during the Crisis.

### Notable Establishments
- **The Bloated Toad** - Infamous tavern for mercenaries and brigands
- **The Scarlet Drake** - Primary brothel and gambling hall
- **The Brown Pony** - Middle class inn where heroes waited out "Monster 9/11"

## The Shadowlands

The territory surrounding Nejune filled with:
- Magical traps and labyrinths
- Catacombs and nomadic camps
- Outcasts and "nefarious races"
- Greenwater Swamps (trolls, hags, blighted monsters)

## Vassal Settlements

| Location | Population | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Greenwater | 10,000 | Fishing, swamp commerce |
| Kulrath | 21,000 | Dark laboratories, mage colleges |
| Fields of Decay | 8,000 | Magically-forced agriculture |
| Nejune Slaver's Market | 6,000 | Living and undead slave trade |
| Mausoleums of Ruin | 100+ | Ancient tombs of necromancers |
