## Description

The great forest realm of AETERNUM, THE FELLWOOD has been cleansed following the crisis. GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT, and many other furry forest friends slowly returned to find it full of bountiful nut, fruit, and berry.

A peerless elven warrior known as "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" has gathered a band of hunters and mercenaries and now runs the power channels of those lands in shadow. Rumors say it is the broken and unpredictable AENARION THE HAWK himself, though others claimed he died in battle during the end of the war.

The forest contains ancient groves sacred to Silvanus and other nature deities.
