## Description

The rebuilt mercantile capital and now the strongest kingdom by far on AETERNUM. After the crisis, the human and dwarven council voted in a matriarchal duo of powerful female leaders.

LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR and LADY NYNORA guide the new vision of the rebuilt city with cunning political maneuvering surrounding trade (under the watchful thumb of The Voice and his Guild council).

The city is home to THE GUILD headquarters in THE GUILD TOWER and serves as the primary base of operations for the Rusitauri's staff and followers.
