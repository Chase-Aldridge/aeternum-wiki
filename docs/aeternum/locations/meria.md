## Description

The cosmopolitan and free port city that boasts the **largest population in Aeternum**. Seat of House Meria, this urban sprawl flows with well-earned coin and cultural mirth.

Many sects, orders, communities, and conclaves of all races have made their home here due to the **meritocratic stance** of the nobles. This has also led to a 100-year rule of an advanced **criminal syndicate underworld**.

## City Districts

### Trade Quarter
The mercantile heart of the city, bustling with commerce from across Aeternum.

### Dock Quarter
Home to the second-largest naval fleet on the continent (behind only House Dargo).

### Guildhall Quarter
Center of guild politics and craft organizations.

## Naval Power

While their fleets are less focused on war than on trade, the fleets of House Meria are **second only to House Dargo** in sea power.

## Current Status (1116 AE)

Meria has become the **strongest power** on Aeternum following the Crisis, ruled by:
- **Lady Ellyssa Rorinstar** - Former pirate admiral

Both operate under the watchful guidance of [The Voice](/docs/aeternum/characters/the-voice) and [The Guild](/docs/aeternum/factions/the-guild).
