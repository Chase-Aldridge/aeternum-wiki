## Description

A chain of islands off the coast of AETERNUM where settlers continue to arrive from and depart to via DARGO. The peoples are slowly integrating with the local populations and establishing larger colonies.

WAJA-SAN, the island village founded by the DRACONISS dragonborn, is located here. Named to honor their sensei and his peaceful death in 1112AE, it is where KISHIMOTO DRACONBLADE and BENGROR THE MIGHTY train the next generation in the ways of Dragon Bushido.

Some claim the few surviving forsaken mutants were saved due to their psionic gifts and headed south by sea to THE EMERALD ISLES.
