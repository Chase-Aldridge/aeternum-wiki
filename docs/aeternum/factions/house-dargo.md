## Overview

Traditionally dominant due to its **maritime and fast-attack military fleets** able to control most coastlines. During previous wars, House Dargo won huge victories at sea, making them rich with spoils.

In recent decades, they saw steady decline due to political machinations by House Nejune sanctioning their sea trade.

## Military Power

Known for religious orders of **crusader knights and paladins**:
- Formidable on horseback on open plains
- Devastating in boarding action on high seas
- Religion and dogma permeate every caste level

## Religious Culture

Chief veneration: **Lokhir** - God of War and Luck

Some knights openly devote to **Bahamut**, though frowned upon by nobility as a "foreign god."

Advancement path:
1. Squire → Ward → Yeoman → Soldier
2. Prove worthy through mighty quest or tournament victory
3. Admitted to Dargo paladin order training

## Political Situation

High Templar Beren signed treaty with House Aetherius believing it would:
- Return Dargo to military might of old
- Finally crush House Nejune

**Unknown to Beren:** Much of the populace and lesser nobles plotted against him, seeking profit through trade with Aetherius.
