# CLAN THORGREM

| **Alignment** | Lawful Good |

## Description

The dwarven clan that has retaken and resettled THANES HOLD with help from GUILD and MERIA forces in a brutal war of attrition with the greenskin RED HORDE.

The plutocracy of the dwarven merchant guilds under the iron fist of HIGH KING THANOR are now in ascendancy once more as they reopen trade and return to their top economic monopolies on forged goods and ores.
