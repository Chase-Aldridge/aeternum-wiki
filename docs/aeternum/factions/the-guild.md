# THE GUILD

**Leader:** The Voice
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral

## Description

The most powerful organization in post-crisis AETERNUM. THE GUILD has slowly, unbeknownst to much of the populace, subjected them to its "benevolent" propaganda and instilled a new secular, meritocratic philosophy known as "The Oath" which has taken root.

This system promotes:
- Formation of artisan guilds
- Banishing of noble houses
- Rise of the common man through sweat, blood, and genius

THE VOICE and CICERO WINDBLADE now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits.

Headquarters are in THE GUILD TOWER in MERIA, with THE SHADOW CITADEL in LIMBO serving as THE VOICE's personal throne (formerly belonging to the slain god KET).
