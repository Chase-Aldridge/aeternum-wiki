## Overview

House Nejune was rightly feared and shrouded in secrecy for commanding deadly magical forces rivaling even House Aetherius.

Ruled by:
- Vile necromancers raising the dead
- Insane wizards locked in towers
- Cunning sorcerers dealing artifacts to other houses

## Military Power

No standing army as such - only:
- Mercenaries hired by warring magical circles
- Undead servants and slaves
- Summoned planar horrors (as last resort)

Other houses historically stayed killing blows for fear of **eldritch horror and planar gateways** used in desperation.

## Religious Culture

Primary worship: **Heronimus** - God of Death & Magic

The "Dark Power Thesis" from the dawn era mages that founded House Nejune guides their philosophy.

- **Power Rating:** 3/10
