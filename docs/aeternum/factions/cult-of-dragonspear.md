## Description

The rising cult that seized power in DARGO with shadowy GUILD assistance, installing a semi-dictatorship.

They purged the forsaken from the city and helped overthrow the nobility. RYLAND THE PIOUS serves as the new steward, though the throne remains empty.

KING BEREN, GEREN THE WARHAMMER, and KING ZADSHEN are all revered as saints by the cult.
