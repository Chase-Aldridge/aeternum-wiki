## Overview

Known for mastery in all dealings of:
- Commerce and trade
- Subterfuge and politics
- "Underhanded" statecraft

House Meria has remained **independent from binding treaties** and largely unscathed by house wars for 100 years. Legendary guilds of charismatic statesmen, thieves, assassins, merchant lords, and pirates dominate its political landscape.

## Military Power

Standing armies of grizzled:
- Rogues and monks
- Rangers and bards

Can marshal fearsome land and sea forces to protect their trade empire. Their fleet is **second only to House Dargo** in sea power.

## Religious Culture

**Note:** Ket was **SLAIN** during the events of 1111 AE. The Shadow Citadel in Limbo (formerly Ket's headquarters) now serves as throne for The Voice.

## Political Influence

Leaders are tolerated by other houses due to:
- Leverage through their sizable fleet
