# THE ARKEN COMPANY

**Leader:** Formerly Cicero Windblade
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil

## Description

THE ARKEN COMPANY, led by CICERO himself, assassinated all the noble lords of AETHERIUS save LORD APELION, sending the city into political turmoil.

The company is officially disbanded after the crisis, and their assassin forces were absorbed back into THE GUILD. FORT BANE, their former base, was converted into a trade port as part of MERIA.
