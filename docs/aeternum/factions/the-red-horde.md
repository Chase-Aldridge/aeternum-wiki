## Overview

A largely ragtag yet highly ferocious nomadic horde comprising all evil bands and tribes ravaging through The Gray Wastes. Historically most dangerous to themselves through constant tribal warfare, since 1000 AE they have seemingly come to heel under warlord **Ugluk the Red**.

## Composition

| Race | Role |
|------|------|
| Orcs | Primary warriors, leadership |
| Goblins | Scouts, night raiders |

| Kobolds | Tunnel warfare |
| Bugbears | Shock troops |
| Hobgoblins | Hunter-killer squads |
| Giants | Siege warfare |
| Ogres | Heavy infantry |

## Territory: The Gray Wastes

- **Population:** 330,000 estimated
- Forbidden mountain plains and wastelands
- Traditional homeland of "evil" races
- Constant tribal warfare and pillaging

### The Mouth of Woe
- Legendary entrance to vast Underdark caverns
- Named during War of Beards when dwarven/elven armies fell
- Patrolled by orc warbands and goblin cutthroats
- Myths speak of tunnels under the sea to distant lands

## Rise to Power

40 years ago, Ugluk managed to:
- Wipe out or unite majority of tribes
- Lay waste to any army penetrating the Wastes

What started as precision raids escalated to full-scale warfare:
- Multiple major assaults repelled at Thane's Hold and Gray Gate
- Hunter-killer packs stepped up night raids
- Assassinations of military commanders

## Religious Motivation

Worship **Bel'Mog** - Orc God of Conquerors

Shamans claim Bel'Mog demands **complete subjugation** of the continent, meaning total war against the four great houses.

## Political Intrigue

Rumors circulate that brash rogue nobility of House Meria sought to **buy off** receptive orc and giant warlords, promising vast riches in exchange for horde forces in house warfare.
