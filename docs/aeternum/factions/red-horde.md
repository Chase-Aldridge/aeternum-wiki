# THE RED HORDE

| | |
|---|---|
| **Leader** | Various Orc and Goblin Chiefs |
| **Alignment** | Chaotic Evil |

## Description

The remnants of the greenskin armies that threatened AETERNUM during the crisis.

THE RED HORDE remnants are said to have largely moved their tribes and warbands underground into the Underdark near and around THE MOUTH OF WOE as the forces of order gained power after 1111AE.

They continue to clash with THORGREM and MERIA forces in THE GRAY WASTES.
