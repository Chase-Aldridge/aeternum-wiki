# Act I: The Call

*Chapters 1-6 | Levels 1-6 | 1111.1AE - 1111.2AE*

The beginning of the Fellowship's journey, from chance meeting to sworn brotherhood.

---

## Chapter I: A Fated Meeting
**1111.1AE | Level 1**

Our adventuring party first found themselves meeting under lucky auspices around pints of ale in the famous tavern in Meria, THE LAUGHING DRAGON. A dragonborn samurai, a wild human paladin, a wood elf rogue, an aasimar paladin, and a mute human cleric all gathered round a table and eyed one another curiously...

They were offered two dangerous mercenary jobs by the venerable dwarven barkeep BRORNOR BATTLEHAND. That night they fended off an assassination attempt by ninja operatives of THE GOLDEN ORDER. The next day they made for the western reaches of The Gray Hills to hunt a wanted goblin scouting party.

## Chapter II: The First Hunt
**1111.1AE | Level 2**

The fellowship continued their goblin hunt along THE NORTH ROAD leading from MERIA to THANE'S HOLD. They encountered:
- An AETHERIUS trade caravan attacked by ogres
- News that THE GRAY GATE was under attack
- Bands of kobolds looting dwarven traders

They entered a cave marked on their contract map and engaged goblin warriors bearing the mark of "The Red Hand." After slaying the orc boss and clearing the cavern, they discovered caches of weapons, supplies, and loot—evidence of THE RED HORDE's growing threat.

## Chapter III: Meria's Code
**1111.1AE | Level 3**

As the fellowship caught their breath in darkness, ZADSHEN suddenly vanished in a blip of sparkling blue light—teleported to the Outlands to meet a vision from LEVIATHAN where he swore an oath of vengeance.

The group continued deeper, slaying:
- A goblin shaman with bone and feather headdress
- A caged, mutated troll
- Multiple bands of goblin cutthroats

They rescued FERIN, a ranger and sole survivor of a previous mercenary party. On recovered scrolls, they found direct orders from UGLUK THE RED and his lieutenant GAUOREZZ NIGHTSTALKER.

Returning to MERIA, they collected their bounty from BRORNOR and learned dire news: HOUSE AETHERIUS had not sent reinforcements to THE GRAY GATE. War was brewing.

## Chapter IV: Road to the Wood
**Last days of 1111.1AE | Level 4**

The party decided to head south to THE FELLWOOD after receiving visions:
- ULRICK was warned by SILVANUS about his path of revenge
- ZADSHEN received clues about a fallen angel in the FELLWOOD
- SHOREA dreamed of BAHAMUT urging him to release the bound demon in his sword

During the week in MERIA:
- ULRICK saw the ocean for the first time
- ARCA sought acolytes of ALAYA
- SHOREA heard of his senpai YURIO ZARASHI in DARGO
- NYNORA researched coded letters from the mysterious 'W'

The second letter, written in Draconic, warned: *"Nejune moves against Dargo on the Blood Moon"*

ZADSHEN received an offer from BRAX to serve as sworn guards in THANE'S HOLD for 11,000 gold pieces per year—the dwarves preparing to seal their gates against THE RED HORDE.

They headed south, slaying bandits of THE BLACK GULLS and encountering a dire wolf pack hunting hobgoblins of THE RED HORDE.

## Chapter V: Memories of Oakenleaf
**1111.2AE | Level 5**

ULRICK led the group to his home village of OAKENLEAF, where they found:
- The village preparing for evacuation
- THALINDRA, his mentor, bedridden with a dark illness—THE BLIGHTROT
- Chief BERUUS and elders debating their fate

THALINDRA shared grim news:
- War brewing between HOUSE NEJUNE and THE FELLWOOD
- THE RED HORDE recruiting hobgoblin commandos from the north
- Undead sightings increasing in the south
- NEJUNE seeking to end the line of HOUSE DARGO

She spoke of the Council to be held at FELLWOOD WATCH in one week, where AENARION had called all woodland leaders. MISTRAYA herself might attend—the oldest elf alive, potentially immortal, seeking to become the Avatar of Alaya.

ULRICK convinced the elders to evacuate. THALINDRA, accepting her death, passed all her magic and destiny to her student in an all-night vigil.

The party rode west, encountering cursed werebears and evidence of spreading darkness.

## Chapter VI: Death in the Dark
**1111.2AE | Level 6**

Racing toward ALAYA'S REST to escort MISTRAYA to the Council, the party:
- Slew a pack of feasting ghouls (SHOREA nearly killed while paralyzed)
- SHOREA battled the demon in GLAW and was shown a vision of BAHAMUT urging him to seek MISTRAYA to cleanse the blade

They joined MISTRAYA's caravan and were assigned to the rear guard. That night, at camp, disaster struck:

### The Assassination Attempt

BOREAS THE OX and his assassins attacked:
- Three wands of fireball erupted, killing guards and eagles
- BOREAS presented a writ of assassination under "the Law of Bane"
- Globes of darkness blinded the heroes
- Poison bolts killed most remaining guards

In the chaos:
- MISTRAYA grabbed ULRICK and escaped through a teleportation portal
- ELDRATHA led the remaining heroes through magical darkness
- Guards willingly sacrificed themselves for the Prophecy of Alaya

The survivors appeared at a waystone circle outside FELLWOOD WATCH. MISTRAYA revealed she had foreseen this night in divination—the deaths were part of the timeline she had chosen.

The shell-shocked party entered the fort, where thousands of refugees were gathering. ULRICK met DRELL, a warlock of OBERON, who offered to teach him the ways of the fey pact...
