*Levels 7-10 | Heroes Rise*

## Summary

The second act sees the fellowship grow in power and renown. They attend the Council of the Wood, delve into ancient tombs, and begin to uncover the corruption spreading across Aeternum.

Tragedy strikes when Ulrick falls to darkness, and the heroes must journey to the great city of Nejune. In the catacombs beneath the city, Zadshen makes a heroic sacrifice. The Silver Sentinels are broken, and the fellowship voyages to Dargo seeking allies.
