# RYLAND THE PIOUS

**Title:** Steward of Dargo
**Race:** Human

## Description

RYLAND THE PIOUS is a priest from the CULT OF DRAGONSPEAR who became the new steward of DARGO.

After the political chaos when COUNT QUERLOS went missing and the rising cult seized power with shadowy GUILD assistance, RYLAND was installed. The throne remains empty as both PRINCE FAGREN and PRINCESS HERA DRAGONSPEAR were found dead.
