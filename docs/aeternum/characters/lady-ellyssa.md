## Description

LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR is one of the two powerful female leaders guiding MERIA after the crisis.

Along with LADY NYNORA, their cunning political maneuvering surrounding trade has made MERIA the strongest kingdom by far on AETERNUM (under the watchful thumb of The Voice and his Guild council).
