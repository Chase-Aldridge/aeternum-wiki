# EGGBERT

**Full Name:** Eggbert the Gnome
**Race:** Gnome
**Class:** Wizard
**Affiliation:** [The Fellowship of the Blade](/docs/aeternum/characters/the-fellowship)

## Background

EGGBERT was a gnome wizard and beloved member of the Rusitauri fellowship, known for his wit and magical prowess.

The heroes journeyed to THE MOUTH OF WOE at the end of 1111AE to aid EGGBERT in finding the sealed resting place of his wife and finally letting her go, releasing her body from suspended magical animation.

In a twist of fate, EGGBERT offered his soul heroically in exchange for ZADSHEN's freedom from PANDEMONIUM. He now lies tortured and bound for eternity there, giving the gnome some ironic respite from the chaos of meaninglessness of his life without his wife.
