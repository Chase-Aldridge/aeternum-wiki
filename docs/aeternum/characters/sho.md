# SHO

**Full Name:** Sho the Blade
**Race:** Human
**Class:** Fighter/Samurai
**Affiliation:** [The Fellowship of the Blade](/docs/aeternum/characters/the-fellowship)

## Background

SHO is a skilled swordsman and samurai warrior, one of the fatetouched heroes of the Rusitauri.

After the Aeternum Crisis, SHO was deeply affected by witnessing EGGBERT's sacrifice and ZAD's broken state. A remnant mark from the DEMON OF RAGE had colored SHO permanently, making him more aggressive.

Upon landing in REGELUM, he and ODA were assaulted by an army of THE RED SHOGUN, JIREN SAI. They killed around 1,000 soldiers before being captured. When JIREN ordered SHO to commit seppuku, ODA used his domain to conceal them and they escaped via planeshift.

SHO returned to REGELUM as an avenger and began a rebellion against the RED SHOGUN, overcome with rage at the plight of the dragonborn people.
