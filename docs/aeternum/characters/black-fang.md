## Description

BLACK FANG "The Void Walker" is one of the most dangerous entities to emerge during the Aeternum Crisis.

BLACK FANG, NERO VALUS "The Immortal", and the Illithid Lord known as THE PANTOKRATOR allegedly engaged in a titanic magical & psionic duel over the ruins of MAGUS RISE at the end of 1111AE. The results of the battle and the combatants' survival are unknown.

BOREAS THE OX and his entire elite hit squad were slain while hunting the trail of BLACK FANG as THE GUILD sought to tie up loose ends in 1111AE.
