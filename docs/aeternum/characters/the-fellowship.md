# The Fellowship of the Blade

*"The Rúsitauri" - The Sons of the Forest*

The fatetouched heroes who saved Aeternum during the great crisis of 1111 AE.

## The Legend

The Rúsitauri first found themselves meeting under lucky auspices around pints of ale in the famous tavern in Meria, THE LAUGHING DRAGON. A dragonborn samurai, a wild human paladin, a wood elf rogue, an aasimar paladin, and a mute human cleric all gathered round a table and eyed one another curiously...

What began as a chance meeting became the stuff of legend.

Attending THE COUNCIL OF THE WOOD, they learned of the true threats facing Aeternum. They infiltrated NEJUNE, battled through the CATACOMBS, and faced the ancient vampire LORD NEERIUS.

### Act III: The War
The fellowship fought across the continent as war erupted between the great houses. They uncovered the plots of multiple factions and witnessed the rise and fall of demigods.

### Act IV: Resolution
After the fall of NEJUNE and the defeat of ancient evils, the fellowship helped broker peace and went their separate ways.

- Helped elevate THE VOICE to divine status
- Broke the power of HOUSE NEJUNE
- United fractured peoples against common enemies
- Proved that heroes can rise from any origin
