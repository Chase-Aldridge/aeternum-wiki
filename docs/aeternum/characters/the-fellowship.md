# The Fellowship of the Blade

*"The Rúsitauri" - The Sons of the Forest*

The fatetouched heroes who saved Aeternum during the great crisis of 1111AE.

## The Legend

The fatetouched heroes regrouped after the fall of NEJUNE and assisted THE VOICE as members of THE GUILD council in brokering a new, albeit tenuous geopolitical peace on AETERNUM. Seen as legendary protectors of the realm by many and political-extremist vigilantes by others, they helped guide the newly formed council of the continent to stabilize and rebuild the kingdoms of MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD before departing on their own personal quests.

Given leave and considerable political and financial rewards from THE GUILD, the heroes decided to tie up loose ends and finish their business on the continent to depart for the next chapter. Their staff, followers, equipment, fleet, and armory have all now been established both within the GUILD tower inside MERIA as well as in THE SHADOW CITADEL in LIMBO, formerly the slain KET's headquarters which now serves as the throne for THE VOICE.
