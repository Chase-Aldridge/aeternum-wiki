# ZADSHEN DRAGONSPEAR

**Full Name:** King Zadshen Dragonspear
**Race:** Human/Aasimar
**Class:** Paladin
**Affiliation:** [The Fellowship of the Blade](/docs/aeternum/characters/the-fellowship)

## Background

ZADSHEN DRAGONSPEAR, also known as ZAD, was a noble paladin and member of the Rusitauri. He made the ultimate sacrifice during the fellowship's journey.

After being rescued from PANDEMONIUM where he suffered 17 years of torture (from his planar perspective), ZADSHEN chose not to return to AETERNUM. Instead, he retired to serve as an acolyte to THE QUNARI atop MOUNT CELESTIA to fulfill his oath, seek redemption, and live out his remaining years as a mortal aasimar.

King Zadshen is revered as a saint in DARGO because of his sacrifices.
