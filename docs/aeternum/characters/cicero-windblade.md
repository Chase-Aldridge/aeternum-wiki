## Description

CICERO WINDBLADE is the right hand of THE VOICE and one of the most dangerous individuals in AETERNUM.

He and THE VOICE now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits.

CICERO formerly led THE ARKEN COMPANY, the elite assassin force that was officially disbanded after the crisis, with their forces absorbed back into THE GUILD.
