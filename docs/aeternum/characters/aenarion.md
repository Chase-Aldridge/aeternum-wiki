# AENARION THE HAWK

**Title:** Avatar of Silvanus
**Race:** Elf

## Description

AENARION THE HAWK is the only surviving avatar of SILVANUS, the god of wild nature.

He remains missing in action after the Aeternum Crisis, though many believe he is either the new FELLWOOD elven warlord "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" or is backing/training him.
