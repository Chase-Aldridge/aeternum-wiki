# ULRICK

**Full Name:** Ulrick the Fallen
**Race:** Human
**Class:** Warlock
**Affiliation:** [The Fellowship of the Blade](/docs/aeternum/characters/the-fellowship)

## Background

ULRICK was a warlock who fell during the fellowship's adventures, becoming one of the tragic heroes of the Rusitauri.

Due to the breaking of OBERON's power as a god in the Fey Court, the demigod started to fade and his hold on the FEYWILD ended. In the chaos, the disembodied soul of ULRICK escaped and was accidentally planeshifted into the twin heaven plane of BYTOPIA.

There a benevolent wind djinn discovered him and sealed him in a pure adamantine jar, later befriending and bargaining with the hero towards fates unknown.
