# THE VOICE

**Title:** Guildmaster of The Guild
**Race:** Unknown

## Description

THE VOICE is the enigmatic leader of THE GUILD, the most powerful organization in post-crisis AETERNUM.

After the Aeternum Crisis, THE VOICE and CICERO WINDBLADE now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits.

THE VOICE's headquarters is THE SHADOW CITADEL in LIMBO, formerly the slain KET's headquarters.
