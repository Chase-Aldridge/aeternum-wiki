# HIGH KING THANOR

**Title:** King of Thanes Hold
**Race:** Dwarf

## Description

HIGH KING THANOR rules over THANES HOLD, leading the dwarves of CLAN THORGREM.

Under his iron fist, the plutocracy of the dwarven merchant guilds has returned to ascendancy as they reopened trade and returned to their top economic monopolies on forged goods and ores.
