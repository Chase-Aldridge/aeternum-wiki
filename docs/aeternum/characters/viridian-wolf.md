# THE VIRIDIAN WOLF

**Title:** Warlord of the Fellwood
**Race:** Elf

## Description

THE VIRIDIAN WOLF is a peerless elven warrior who has gathered a band of hunters and mercenaries in THE FELLWOOD.

Rumors say it is the broken and unpredictable AENARION THE HAWK himself, though others claimed he died in battle during the end of the war. He now runs the power channels of the Fellwood in shadow.
