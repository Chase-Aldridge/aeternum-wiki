# Kronus, Titan of Time

**Type:** Titan
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
**Domains:** Death, Knowledge, Arcana

## Description

Second and darkest of the Titans, Kronus created temporality and mortality itself.

One of the first 3 titans created, he gave birth to all the other gods of LOR. Worshipped by some factions within the MAGISTERIUM and some planar cults who hope to curry his dark favor.

His dark avatar was summoned and then miraculously banished by the "fatetouched" of The Rusitauri during the Aeternum Crisis of 1111AE, nearly trapping the continent into a deathly magical stasis.
