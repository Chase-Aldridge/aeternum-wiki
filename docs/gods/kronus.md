## The Second Titan

Kronus is the **second and darkest** of the Titans - the primordial beings that created the multiverse, planes, and gods.

---

## Creation

Kronus created:
- **Temporality** - The flow of time itself
- **Mortality** - The concept of endings and death
- **Entropy** - The gradual decay of all things

---

## The Devouring Hunger

Unlike his siblings, Kronus possesses a **devouring appetite** for destruction. His sister Alariel actively protects the gods and creation from his hunger.

---

## Worship

Kronus is chiefly worshipped by:
- Factions within **THE MAGISTERIUM**
- Planar cults hoping to curry his dark favor
- Those seeking forbidden knowledge of time and death

---

## The Aeternum Crisis

During the events of 1111AE, Kronus's **dark avatar was summoned** and nearly trapped the continent of Aeternum into a deathly magical stasis.

The "fatetouched" heroes of The Rusitauri miraculously banished the avatar, preventing catastrophe.

This confirmed that Kronus is not merely myth but an active threat to existence.
