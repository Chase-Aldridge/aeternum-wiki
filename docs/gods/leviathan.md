## Description

Leviathan is the **male god of balance**, appearing as a great blue dragon - arbiter of cosmic equilibrium.

---

## Worship

Leviathan is chiefly worshiped by:
- Aasimar
- Celestials
- Those seeking cosmic balance
- Followers of the Qunari

---

## Champion of Leviathan

During the Aeternum Crisis, **ZADSHEN** was on the path to become Leviathan's Champion:
- Communed with his blade and learned its will
- Leaped from a volcano in a test of faith
- Learned what was needed: 1000 followers, a cleric, and a paladin to manifest Leviathan

Leviathan is an ally to THE QUNARI, and despite Zadshen altering fate with the King Wish and apparently breaking an unknown pact with the celestials, his mission to the dragon god remained the same.

## The Metallic Dragon Mystery

Like Bahamut and Draconiss, Leviathan has chosen not to show himself to the peoples of Aeternum following the Crisis. The reason is unknown.

*"In all things, balance. In balance, peace. Leviathan guards the scales of existence."*
