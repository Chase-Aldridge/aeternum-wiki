# EXARIAN, THE TITAN OF LIGHT

*First of the Three Titans of Creation*

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | Mythological / Believed to Exist |
| **Role** | Creator of Light and Matter |
| **Rank** | Titan (Above Gods) |
| **Plane** | Unknown (Above all creation) |
| **Worshippers** | Few direct worshippers |

---

## The First Titan

Exarian is the **first and oldest** of the Titans - the primordial beings that incarnated in the multiverse and then created the planes, the planet Lor, and all the other gods.

---

## Creation

Exarian created:
- **Light itself** - The fundamental energy of existence
- **Matter** - The substance from which all things are formed
- **The framework of reality** - The structure upon which all planes exist

---

## The Worldtome

Exarian is believed to sit atop his own plane above all creation, writing in **THE WORLDTOME** - a book of metareality that already contains:
- **Past** - All that has happened
- **Present** - All that is happening
- **Future** - All that will happen

This suggests that all of existence is already written, and the Titan merely records what must be.

---

## Appearance

Exarian has **never been described or seen** in all the annals of the ancient elves and dwarves of Lor. No mortal has ever claimed to witness the First Titan.

---

## Worship

Few worship Exarian directly, as:
- No established priesthood exists
- No temples are dedicated to the First Titan
- Communication is considered impossible
- The Titan's will is unknowable

---

## Relationship with Other Titans

| Titan | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| **Kronos** | Younger sibling; Exarian and Alariel contain his destructive nature |
| **Alariel** | Younger sibling; Together they created the gods |

*"Before there was light, there was nothing. Exarian spoke, and existence began."*
