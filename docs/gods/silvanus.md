## Description

Silvanus is the **male god of wild nature**, appearing as a sylvan forest avatar - one of the oldest gods, having arisen from the soul of nature itself on the continent.

---

## Worship

Silvanus is chiefly worshiped by:
- Elves
- Halflings
- Gnomes
- Humans who revere the wild

## The Avatar of Silvanus

During the Aeternum Crisis, Silvanus chose **AENARION THE HAWK** as his avatar in 1111AE.

After the Crisis, AENARION (the only surviving avatar of Silvanus) remains missing in action. Many believe he is either the new FELLWOOD elven warlord "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" or is backing/training him.

## The Fellwood

Silvanus's influence is strongest in THE FELLWOOD, where:
- GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT, and other forest friends have returned to a cleansed land
- The forests are full of bountiful nut, fruit, and berry
- The VIRIDIAN WOLF now runs the power channels in shadow

*"The wild does not bow to civilization. Silvanus ensures it never will."*
