## The Fallen Deity

KET was a god slain during the events leading to or during the Aeternum Crisis.

Little is known about KET's domains, worship, or nature - only that the god fell and their seat of power changed hands.

## The Shadow Citadel

KET's former headquarters, **THE SHADOW CITADEL** in LIMBO, now serves as the throne for **THE VOICE** - the newest demigod who rose to power after the fall of NEJUNE and the defeat of the old demigods.

The heroes of The Rusitauri were granted access to the Shadow Citadel as part of their rewards for saving Aeternum.

## Legacy

KET represents the mortality of even gods - a reminder that divine power is not eternal and can be claimed by those with sufficient might.

*"Even gods can fall. KET is proof."*
