# Bankai & Domain Rules

Custom game mechanics for the World of LOR campaigns.

## Bankai System

### Unlocking Bankai
- Will be unlocked once you have a big "feel something" moment in the plot
- Needs to tie into your lore and/or existing class abilities somehow
- If you haven't "lore unlocked" Bankai by level 13, you'll naturally learn it then

### Using Bankai
- Uses **full action AND bonus action** for that turn
- Can't use again for **1d8 days** after activation
- Only lasts **1 minute** if combat ability
- Utility abilities could last up to **10 minutes** (DM approval)

### Bankai Design
- Can be an attack, ability, spell, and/or aura
- Near limitless options to create what it does
- Tell DM your concept, they'll assign dice, rolls, checks, etc.
- **Trade-offs required**: Pure offense may have defense debuff, etc.

### Bankai Power
- Bankai can **override any other action or buff** from enemy
- Exceptions: Legendary enemies, other Bankai, or other domains

## Bankai Progression

| Level | Unlock |
|-------|--------|
| **Base** | Base level bankai (stronger than first campaign) |
| **Ultimate** | Ultimate Bankai - more uses, abilities, flexibility |
| **Domain** | Domain Expansion (Ryoiki Tenkai) |
| **???** | Unknown final tier |

## Level-Based Bonuses

| Level | Bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 14 | +1 extra reaction per turn |
